# ComputerVision
Projects: Virtual Painter, Document Scanner and License Plate Detector
Basic concept of Images. The RGB Channels and Gray Scale Images.
how to read images videos and webcam.
opencv functions for beginners. Gray Scale, Blur, Edge Detection, Dialation and Erosion.
crop and resize and image. Resize could be used to scale up or scale down an image where cropping can be used to get a part of the image.
create blank images along with how to draw Lines, rectangles, circles and custom text.
create a warp prespective of a selected area of an image using fixed points.
detect any color in an image using the HSV space with the help of opencv Trackbars.
detect shapes of objects by finding their contours. Contours are basically outline that bound the shape or form of an object. So we will be detecting multiple shapes and how many corners points each shape has along with its area .
detect faces in realtime using Viola Jones method.
Detecting Color and using colored marker to draw virtually.
create a simple document scanner using opencv. We will learn how to run this in real time
detect number plates on cars in realtime and save them with a click of a button.
